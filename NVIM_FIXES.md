# Neovim Configuration Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Plugin Manager Conflict
- **Problem**: Both Packer and Lazy.nvim were installed, causing potential conflicts
- **Solution**: Removed `packer_compiled.lua` file to eliminate conflict
- **Impact**: Configuration now uses only Lazy.nvim as the plugin manager

### 2. Duplicate Theme Entries
- **Problem**: Some themes were duplicated in `colorschemes.lua`
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate entries for:
  - `rebelot/kanagawa.nvim`
  - `arzg/vim-colors-xcode`
- **Impact**: Cleaner plugin configuration, faster loading

### 3. Improved Theme Error Handling
- **Problem**: Theme configuration would fail if themes weren't installed
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling in `theme.lua`:
  - Added `is_theme_available()` function
  - Improved `switch_theme()` function with retry logic
  - Better fallback to built-in themes
- **Impact**: More stable theme switching, no crashes on missing themes

### 4. LSP Configuration Cleanup
- **Problem**: LSP configuration had duplicated/commented-out code
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all commented-out duplicate code
  - Restored proper `on_attach` function
  - Enhanced LSP handlers with proper icons
- **Impact**: Cleaner, more maintainable LSP configuration

### 5. Indent-Blankline Plugin Fix
- **Problem**: Plugin was trying to use non-existent highlight groups ('Function', 'Label')
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced with custom highlight groups ('IblScope', 'IblIndent')
  - Added theme-aware color configuration
  - Added automatic re-setup when colorscheme changes
- **Impact**: Indent guides now work reliably with all colorschemes

## Available Commands:

### Theme Management:
- `:ThemeInfo` - Show current theme and total available themes
- `:ThemeSwitch <theme_name>` - Switch to a specific theme
- `:ThemeRandom` - Switch to a random theme

### LSP Keybindings:
- `gD` - Go to declaration
- `gd` - Go to definition
- `K` - Show hover documentation
- `gi` - Go to implementation
- `<C-k>` - Signature help
- `<space>rn` - Rename symbol
- `<space>ca` - Code actions
- `gr` - Show references
- `<space>f` - Format code

## Configuration Status:
✅ Lazy.nvim plugin manager working  
✅ Theme system working with 200+ themes  
✅ LSP configuration clean and functional  
✅ No plugin conflicts  
✅ Proper error handling  
✅ Indent-blankline plugin working with all themes  

## Notes:
- The configuration is set to use "evening" theme by default
- Transparency is enabled by default
- Some themes may not be installed yet - they will be downloaded when first used
- LSP servers (pyright, clangd) need to be installed separately if you want LSP functionality
